# P3DMacro
This is obsolete source code from a small macro keybinding project.

The executable binds the pressed mouse wheel to the input of the spacebar. This only happens when the p3d.exe is running.
This binding of the keyboard input makes it possible to look around by pressing the mouse wheel, which was not possible to configure in the Prepar3D settings.
